# Reading SICP with help from Brian Harvey's Spring 2011 CS61A course

## What are CS61A and SICP?

CS61A is an undergraduate computer science course taught at the University of California Berkeley. The 2011 course taught by Brian Harvey is [recommended](https://eu.small-improvements.com/app/objectives/g0d7VX8qzbLHJMsVXfTZtw/teachyourselfcs.com) as a high-quality resource to learn the fundamental concepts of programming in depth. It uses [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) (SICP, or "the wizard book") as its textbook.

This objective comprises reading from SICP, pre-recorded video lectures, homework assignments, projects and an exam.
