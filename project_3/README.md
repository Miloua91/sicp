# Project 3 is broken

Sadly, the project files for Project 3 have seemingly hard dependency on STk, now deprecated. My workaround for the OOP homework using (stklos)[https://www.stklos.net/] also doesn't work.

I've skipped over Project 3 with a heavy heart.

See (blog post)[https://zackads.github.io/blog/cs61a-oop-in-scheme/] for more details.
